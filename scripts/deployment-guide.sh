echo "📋 Next Steps:"
echo ""
echo "1. 🧪 Test locally (no setup needed):"
echo "   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat"
echo ""
echo "2. 🌐 Deploy to testnet:"
echo "   a) Get test MATIC from: https://faucet.polygon.technology/"

echo ""
echo "3. 🔍 Other useful commands:"
echo "   npx hardhat compile                     # Compile contracts"
echo "   npx hardhat test                       # Run tests (if any)"
echo "   npx hardhat clean                      # Clean artifacts"
echo "   npx hardhat node                       # Start local node"

echo "⚠️  IMPORTANT NOTES:"
echo "   • Mumbai testnet is deprecated, use Amoy for new projects"
echo "   • Make sure your wallet has test MATIC before deploying"
echo "   • Never share your private key or commit it to version control"
echo "   • The current PRIVATE_KEY in .env is a placeholder - replace it!"
